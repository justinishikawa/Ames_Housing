#Ames Housing Dataset Analysis

This project looked at the Ames Dataset from Ames, Iowa.  Full analysis of this project was completed as a group for the MScA program at The University of Chicago.  

The first piece I focused on was the cleansing of the dataset: removing or imputing missing values, creating meta features to reduce dimensionality and colliniarity, creating dummy variables (or one hot encoding) and rescaling the data for analysis.

The second piece I focused on was building a Decision Tree Model for classification/prediction and also a XGBoost Tree Model.

Slides related to my model performance are included in the repo.
